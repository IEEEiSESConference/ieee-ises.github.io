Up to a superpolynomial speedup has been reported for quantum algorithms in these areas. Motivated by the promise of faster computations, the development of quantum machines has caught the attention of both academics and industry researchers. Quantum machines are now at sizes where implementations of quantum algorithms or their components are now becoming possible. In order to implement quantum algorithms on quantum machines, resource efficient circuits and functional blocks must be designed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tutorial will cover the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction and Background on Quantum Computing<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quantum Circuits for Galois Field Squaring and Exponentiation<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quantum Circuit Design of Arithmetic Circuits<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quantum Circuits for Image Processing<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concluding Thoughts<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Speaker Biography<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:29% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"228\" height=\"228\" src=\"https:\/\/ieee-ises.org\/2022\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Thapliyal.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1317 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ieee-ises.org\/2022\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Thapliyal.png 228w, https:\/\/ieee-ises.org\/2022\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Thapliyal-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><strong>Himanshu Thapliyal <\/strong>received the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from the University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA, in 2011, where he received the \u201cDistinguished Graduate Achievement Award.\u201d He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA.
