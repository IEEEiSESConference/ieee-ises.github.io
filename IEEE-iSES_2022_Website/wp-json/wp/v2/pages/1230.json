Indian lock-down started on 24 March 2020. IndVentr [www.indventr.com] consortium was formed on 29 March 2020 to develop affordable emergency ventilators. There were many COVID patients that required ventilators at the time to manage the virus and there were limited commercial ventilators. We saw ourselves capable of rising to that challenge. We started with a small group of people discussing ideas, articles, papers, open source ventilator projects, and coming up with a design and plan of action to realize that design. We had different layers of expertise with individuals and in combinations of teams. We had 3 companies working as a team to make it happen: each with its area of expertise with centralized organization scheme and regular remote meetings for understanding progress. We had no prior expertise in biomedical systems or being medical care providers. Adaptation happened to additional needed expertise through learning online. We developed ambu based and pneumatically controlled ventilators. Join the seminar to walk through the unusual journal of open innovation and inclusive leadership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Speaker Biography:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vishnu Vadakkepat has a B.Tech degree from Manipal Institute of Technology.
