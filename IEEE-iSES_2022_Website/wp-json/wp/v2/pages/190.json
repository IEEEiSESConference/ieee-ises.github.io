Malfunctions in computing systems have consequences ranging from annoying computer crashes, loss of data and services, to financial and productivity losses, or even loss of human life. Such impacts continue to increase as systems become more complex, interconnected, and pervasive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardware failures are especially a growing concern:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Existing verification methods cannot cope with today\u2019s complexity, causing significant design flaws (bugs) and security vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Today&#8217;s manufacturing test methods cannot meet the levels of thoroughness demanded by today&#8217;s (and future) systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. For advanced silicon technologies, reliability failures, largely benign in the past, are becoming visible at the system level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Beyond-silicon NanoSystems create new testing and reliability challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These barriers appear at a time when end-users &#8212; from (autonomous) cars to the cloud &#8212; &#8220;really&#8221; care about robustness: design bugs, manufacturing defects, reliability, and security.<br>This talk will define golden opportunities for new approaches that overcome the above seemingly diverse problems at seemingly diverse scales. Robustness will then become an essential 21st-century system feature rather than a cost burden that was characteristic of 20th-century thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Speaker Biography<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subhasish Mitra<\/strong> is Professor of Electrical Engineering and of Computer Science at Stanford University.

Industries have established R&amp;D processes, plant operations, supply chains and technologies. Now the industries need to change and improve the sets of processes to remain competitive. Industry 4.0 is a broad term involving modern technologies and processes that can integrate, replace or improve legacy technologies and processes leading to improved productivity. With improvements in productivity and efficiency, the carbon footprint will reduce which in turn will contribute towards sustainability.<br>Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Automation are transforming industries to cyber physical systems. With historical data and insights along preventive maintenance, the entire production line can be visualised, and decisions can be taken autonomously. When industries embrace the Industry 4.0 transformation, skill sets in AI, IoT, Robotics and Automation will dominate, while certain typical job profiles ceasing to exist in the next 5 or 7 years. As per the World Economic Forum report 2020, by 2025, 85 million jobs may be displaced by a shift in the division of labour between humans and machines. However, some 97 million new roles may emerge that are more adapted to the new division of labour among humans, machines, and algorithms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Increased awareness about Industry 4.0 and sustainability is essential and school curricula need changes to prepare graduates who are future ready.

The technology known as \u201cKelquan\u201d delivers full duplex 480 Mbit\/s up to 1000 ft. of telephone wire and full duplex up to 80 Mbit\/s on 5000 ft. telephone wire. The product has been fully tested on the test-bed as well as real networks. It also supported Full duplex 1 Giga Bit\/second for 100 meters of VHDL Link (IEEE 802.15 ac) &nbsp;It has been transferred for manufacturing and deployment to an outsource Company. Commercial name may be different, but is applicable to 1 Gbit\/s data operation on IEEE 802.15ac and VDSL2 channels. The product is based on Dr. Vaman\u2019s \u201cPioneer\u201d patent which was co-authored with late Elliot Gruenberg and issued in 1999. Dr. Vaman also implemented Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) which is used in 5G LTE, Wireless and VDSL infrastructure for achieving high speed data transfer rates. This was required to compare the actual implementation of \u201cKelquan\u201d with the implementation of OFDM. Even though, theoretically, OFDM can increase unlimited data transfer rate, it is limited by high Peak to Average Power ratio that limits its performance. The power spectral efficiency is limited to less than 10 while the standard expects over 15. Kelquan with limited carriers can achieve better performance over that of OFDM. Both technologies coexist in wireless and wired networks. More recently, he has been working on supporting protocols and distributed network management systems for deep space communications using HF signals. He is also working on access protocols for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) for increasing the throughputs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Robust Systems in the 21st Century Abstract: Computing systems are an indispensable part of all our lives.
