Efficient and secure data sensing, storage, and processing play pivotal roles in current information age. The state-of-the-art nanoelectronic technology based hardware systems cater to the needs of efficient sensing, storage, and computing. At the same time, efficient algorithms and software used for faster analysis and retrieval of desired information are becoming increasingly important. Big data which are large, complex data sets, are now a part of the Internet world. Storing and processing needs of the enormous amount of structured and unstructured data are getting increasingly challenging. At the same time, Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been evolving with simultaneous development of hardware and software and span across everyday consumer electronics. The performance and efficiency of the present as well as the future generations of computing and information processing systems are largely dependent upon advances in both hardware and software.<\/p>\n<p>iNIS 2017 is sponsored by IEEE-CS under TCVLSI. iNIS has been initiated as a sponsored meeting of Technical Committee on VLSI, IEEE-CS (http:\/\/www.ieee-tcvlsi.org\/) that endorses a league of successful meetings such as ASAP, ISVLSI, ARITH, etc., which are now presented as \u201cSister Conferences\u201d in the iNIS website. iNIS brings together leading scientists and researchers from academia and industry. Contributions are sought in (but are not limited to) the following areas:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Nanoelectronic VLSI and Sensor Systems (NVS)<\/li>\n<li>Energy-Efficient, Reliable VLSI Systems (ERS)<\/li>\n<li>Hardware\/Software for Internet of Things (IOT) and Consumer Electronics (CE)<\/li>\n<li>Hardware for Secure Information Processing (SIP)<\/li>\n<li>Hardware\/Software Solutions for Big Data (SBD)<\/li>\n<li>Cyber Physical Systems and Social Networks (CSN)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>iNIS 2017 proceedings will be published by IEEE-CS conference publication services (CPS). Authors are invited to submit full-length (6 pages maximum), original, unpublished research papers with an abstract (200 words maximum).<\/p>\n<h2>Evaluation and Template<\/h2>\n<p>Papers violating length would be excluded from the review process. Previously published papers or papers currently under review for other conferences\/journals should not be submitted and will not be considered for publication. Authors should submit their original work of maximum 6 pages using double-column IEEE-CS conference format-template. A selected papers from iNIS 2017 program will be invited for submission to a peer-reviewed journal special issue based on reviewer feedback and quality of conference presentation.<\/p>\n<h2>Publication and Presentation<\/h2>\n<p>Presentation details will follow notifications of acceptance.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Submit<\/h2>\n<p>Submissions must be submitted to iNIS 2017 EasyChair conference management system.<\/p>\n<h2>Important Dates<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper Submission :&nbsp;<del>28 July 2017<\/del>&nbsp;<strong>(Extended to August 15, 2017)<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Authors Notification :&nbsp;15 September 2017<\/li>\n<li>Camera Ready : 10 October 2017<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Submissions close at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12)<\/p>\n<h2>Special Sessions and Panels (SSP)<\/h2>\n<p>iNIS 2017 will consider proposals for special sessions as well as panels. Special session and panel proposals\/papers can be submitted to \u201cSpecial Sessions and Panels\u201d track at the online submission link. The submission deadline is the same as specified for the regular paper submissions. All accepted special session papers will be published in the conference proceedings.<\/p>\n<h2>Student Research Forum (SRF)<\/h2>\n<p>iNIS 2017 will host a student research forum. Authors should submit their original unpublished work of maximum 4 pages using IEEE-CS double-column conference format-template. Manuscripts in PDF format with author information (optional) should be submitted to the \u201cStudent Research Forum\u201d track at the online submission link. The submission deadline is the same as specified for the regular paper submissions. All the accepted student research symposium papers will be published in the conference proceedings.<\/p>\n<h2>Award Information<\/h2>\n<p><strong>3 student travel awards of $250 each for travel to iNIS 2017.
