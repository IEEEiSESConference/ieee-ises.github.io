However, grocery shopping can be a frustrating experience for those with visual impairment. While getting to a grocery shop itself is not as much of a challenge for them, locating and picking the items in the grocery shelf becomes a task as challenging as picking a needle from the haystack. Imagine picking up five items for your dinner recipe from a typical grocery store in the US that carries around 35,000 unique items and can have more than 30 aisles spanning 45,000 square meters. This talk will showcase synergistic advances in algorithms, architectures and interface design for assisting those with visual impairment to do shopping.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Biography :<\/strong>\u00a0Vijay Narayanan is a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and Electrical Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University.

Sensor systems monitoring environment, health care, water quality, vehicle traffic, smart cities are becoming the norm. Despite extended range of applications low power requirement is the key to these nanosystems. Incorporation of different nanodevices into these nanosystems with functionalities that do not necessarily scale according to \u201cMoore\u2019s Law,\u201d but provide additional value in different ways (more than Moore), is necessary. It is therefore important to get exposed to the current trend in chip fabrication, device structures and fabrication (gate stack design and fabrication), device and circuit relationship and design, reliability of new devices and processes. Furthermore, nanoelectronic devices with extremely low power consumption depends on the next generation high-k deposition process, precise selection of deposition parameters, pre-deposition surface treatments and subsequent annealing temperatures. In this talk, some of the recent developments in device fabrication for electronics devices and IoT devices will be outlined.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"tx-column tx-column-size-1-2\">\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-96 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348im_\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Durga.png?resize=150%2C150\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-attachment-id=\"96\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348\/http:\/\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/keynotes\/durga\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Durga.png?fit=212%2C247\" data-orig-size=\"212,247\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Durga\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Durga.png?fit=212%2C247\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Durga.png?fit=212%2C247\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Durgamadhab (Durga) Mishra<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Professor &amp; Associate Chair for Graduate Program, FELLOW of The Electrochemical Society<\/p>\n<p>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology Newark, NJ, USA<\/p>\n<p>Title : Challenges of Converging Nanoelectronics and Nanotechnology for Internet of Things<\/p>\n<p>Tentative Date: 18th Dec 2017<\/p>\n<p>Tentative Time: TBA<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Biography :<\/strong>\u00a0Durga Misra is a Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, USA.

With so many potential issues facing conventional microelectronic technologies, novel approaches to circuit design and even non-classical devices warrant exploration. Add to this mix of challenges the reality of security vulnerabilities that must be addressed at early design stages such that emerging nanoelectronic systems must be both efficient and trustworthy. As a specific case study, this talk will focus on memristor based systems. Given their low power operation and small footprint, memristors have emerged as excellent candidates for future memory and logic. However, the non-volatility of memristors also presents certain security challenges whereby sensitive data may be vulnerable. At the same time, memristors also show promise for effective security primitives such as physical unclonable functions and random number generators.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"tx-column tx-column-size-1-2\">\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-98 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348im_\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/GRose_Headshot.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348im_\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/GRose_Headshot.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348im_\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/GRose_Headshot.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150 300w, https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348im_\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/GRose_Headshot.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150 450w\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-attachment-id=\"98\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348\/http:\/\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/keynotes\/grose_headshot\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/GRose_Headshot.jpg?fit=504%2C715\" data-orig-size=\"504,715\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"GRose_Headshot\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/GRose_Headshot.jpg?fit=211%2C300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/GRose_Headshot.jpg?fit=504%2C715\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Garrett S.

Now imagine when all of this happens at once, and the victim is unaware of its occurrence until much later. This is the reality, as increasing amount of electronic devices are used as keys, wallets and files. Security attacks targeting embedded systems illegally gain access to information or destroy information. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is used to protect many of these embedded systems. While mathematically shown to be quite secure, it is now well known that AES circuits and software implementations are vulnerable to side channel attacks. Side-channel attacks are performed by observing properties of the system (such as power consumption, electromagnetic emission, etc.) while the system performs cryptographic operations. In this talk, differing power based attacks are described, and various countermeasures are explained. In particular, a countermeasure titled Algorithmic Balancing is described in detail. Implementation of this countermeasure in hardware and software is described. Since process variation impairs countermeasures, we show how this countermeasure can be made to overcome process variations.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"tx-column tx-column-size-1-2\">\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-102 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348im_\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/sri_parameswaran.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" data-attachment-id=\"102\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348\/http:\/\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/keynotes\/sri_parameswaran\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/sri_parameswaran.jpg?fit=219%2C244\" data-orig-size=\"219,244\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"sri_parameswaran\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/sri_parameswaran.jpg?fit=219%2C244\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180720023348\/https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/ieee-inis.oui.edu.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/sri_parameswaran.jpg?fit=219%2C244\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sri Parameswaran<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Professor &amp; Program Director for Computer Engineering, School of Computer Science and Engineering<\/p>\n<p>The University of New South Wales, Australia<\/p>\n<p>Title : QUADSEAL : A Hardware Countermeasure against Side channel Attacks on AES<\/p>\n<p>Tentative Date:\u00a019th Dec 2017<\/p>\n<p>Tentative Time: TBA<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Short Biography :<\/strong>\u00a0Sri Parameswaran is a Professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of New South Wales.

One of the big challenges in distributed cyber-physical systems is establishing a common notion of time between the physical world and the computational system. Many modern CPS, especially industrial automation systems, require the actions of different computational systems to be synchronized at much higher rates than is possible through ad hoc designs. Fundamental research is needed in synchronizing clocks of computing systems to a higher degree, and even if the clocks are synchronized, designing CPS nodes so that they can perform actions in a synchronized manner is challenging. We need to find ways to specify distributed CPS applications, ways to specify and verify timing requirements on distributed CPS, confident top-down design methodologies that can ensure the system meets its timing requirements in the first go, dynamically creating and dissolving timing domains using differently build components, and much more.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>In this talk, I will present some of the work that we have done, and some of the ideas that we want to pursue in order to solve the challenge of confident and simplified CPS design (from the timing perspective). We believe that confident CPS design is possible only when the timing requirements of CPS are specified in the application itself, and not as a separate document. It should not be a list of separate requirements, but must be married to the application specification in as natural way as possible. Second, we need techniques to design the CPS in one-shot. Provably correct by construction is very good, but even design methodologies that improve the confidence in design are also very important. Finally, there should be automated methods to test the CPS.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Biography :\u00a0<\/strong>Prof. Aviral Shrivastava is Associate Professor in the School of Computing Informatics and Decision Systems Engineering at the Arizona State University, where he has established and heads the Compiler and Microarchitecture Labs (CML) (http:\/\/aviral.lab.asu.edu\/).
