Due to the stochastic-switching behavior, memristors yield randomness which is the key to the cryptographic applications as well. Memristive cryptographic functions, specifically block ciphers that can encrypt data and provide its confidentiality. In case of smart devices, the random-switching behavior of memristor leads to \u2018encryption\u2019 and thus applied to the security applications. A true random number generator (TRNG) is a hardware component that generates a string of random bits, which can be used as a cryptographic key.

Organizations monetize the data &amp; information captured from documents, server their customers efficiently and stay on top of their business. Document digitization is a multi-billion-dollar industry and is growing.

These are usually cameras (front\/surround view), radar (forward \/ backward-looking) or ultrasonic sensors. ADAS is not just a value-add today; it is also a critical aspect of vehicle safety. The intelligent sensors help us model the environment, analyze the situation, and make decisions to alert the driver or take necessary actions to prevent accidents. Radar is one of the cheaper ADAS sensors, plays a crucial role in enabling the future towards assisted and automated driving.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The session&#8217;s goal is to provide an in-depth view of automotive radar technology and market trends. Coming from an industry perspective, the presenter will try to declutter the current topic of the role of radar in assisted &amp; autonomous driving. A comprehensive historical, technological progression will also be presented to appreciate how the automotive radar transforms itself from a luxury feature towards a commodity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speaker\u2019s Bio:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-549 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ieee-ises.org\/2021\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Anshu-Gupta-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Anshu Gupta<\/strong><\/em>, PhD is currently the global product head for the segment of next generation of high-volume radar business at Continental AG.

V2X stands for Vehicle to Everyone. This is the technology that allows vehicles to communicate with moving parts of the traffic system around them. Also known as connected-vehicle-to-everything communication. V2X is 802.11p based wireless protocol. V2X has several subsets, including vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I). Though mainly used to increase safety, V2X also offers other benefits like enabling automatic payment of toll fees. V2X is instrumental in Non-Line of sight (NLoS), 360 degrees perceptions is Autonomous Vehicles. This technology has End-to-End latency of 20-500 ms, frequency up to 10 Hz, and range up to 1Km. Different countries have different Messaging standards, mainly CAM(EU), BSM(USA) and China (BSM). Vehicle-to-everything technology is expected to grow significantly over the next 20 years, as many top V2X suppliers, such as Delphi, Denso, Qualcomm, and Continental, have large-scale integration plans. Many new car models use some form of V2X technology, especially luxury brands. Vehicle-to-everything systems are expected to be added to lower-priced vehicles as well eventually.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speaker\u2019s Bio:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-550 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ieee-ises.org\/2021\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Bibhay-Ranjan-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Bibhay<\/strong><\/em> is working with NVidia, India as Senior System Software Engineer.

As it happened in other countries, a strong government mandate has fuelled its acceleration. Gazette of India, in its recent notification released on 19th August 2021 sets the deadline of Dec 2025 to cover 100% consumers with smart meters in prepayment mode. The main stakeholders in the smart metering program are utilities (DISCOMS), government agencies (such as regulatory bodies, Central Electricity Authority) and last but not least are the electricity consumers. Other than an overall figure of about 25% AT&amp;C losses, there are other compelling drivers for smart metering; Global energy carbon footprint has risen 30% in last 25 years, making Energy Efficiency (EE) a very important subject for the planet. Investment in national infrastructure is a serious subject and questions related to scalability, reliability, security and future-proofing need to be addressed and provisioned for. In this tutorial we would focus on smart metering system, communication technologies, and distribution transformer and sub-station metering. Ratification of Indian Standard (IS 16444) for smart meters had been a great enabler in this mission. Salient features of open (International) data exchange protocols between different AMI devices would also be covered.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keywords: AMI, Energy Efficiency, Integration of Renewables, NBIoT, e-SIM, IPv6, IoT, Cellular, RF Mesh, DLMS-COSEM<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Biography of Speakers<\/h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Anukram Mishra<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-578 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ieee-ises.org\/2021\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Anukram-Mishra-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anukram Mishra has over 34 years of experience in corporate- starting with 7 years in Inertial Navigation and Attack Systems, HAL.
