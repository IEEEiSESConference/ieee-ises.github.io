Building a machine that can function like a human brain, indubitably, is the ultimate dream of a computer architect. Although we have not yet fully understood the working mechanism of human brains, the part that we have learned in past seventy years already guided us to many remarkable successes in computing applications, e.g., artificial neural network and machine learning. Inspired by the working mechanism of human brain, neuromorphic system naturally possesses a massively parallel architecture with closely coupled memory, offering a great opportunity to break the &#8220;memory wall&#8221; in von Neumann architecture. The talk will start with a background introduction of neuromorphic computing, followed by examples of hardware acceleration schemes of learning and neural network algorithms and memristor-based computing engine.

Chronic wounds need to be managed to prevent complications, preserve tissue function, and facilitate healing. Current practice for wound evaluation and wound management includes visually recording the wound area and wound depth to assess healing progress. The need to visit a clinic at least once every week results in poor patient compliance and long-term complication with inferior health outcomes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our research focuses on leveraging advances in electrochemical sensing, fabrication techniques and electronics to develop a new class of affordable wound dressings that enable quantitative measurements of markers of wound healing.

Domain-specific VLSI deep learning accelerators such as Google\u2019s TPU, Apple\u2019s Bionic, and Intel\u2019s Nirvana, now dominate CPUs and GPUs for energy-efficient deep learning processing. However, these electronic accelerators are facing fundamental limits due to the slowdown of Moore\u2019s law and their reliance on metal wires, which have well-known bandwidth and latency limitations. Silicon photonics represents a promising post-Moore technological alternative to overcome the limitations of electronic processing platforms. Not only can photonic interconnects fabricated in CMOS-compatible processes provide near speed of light transfers at the chip-scale, but photonic devices can now also be leveraged to perform computations entirely in the optical domain. In this talk, I will present my vision of how silicon photonics can be used to design an entirely new class of deep learning hardware accelerators that can provide orders of magnitude improvements over conventional electronic accelerators. I will discuss the evolution of silicon photonics over the past two decades, from integrated optics to photonic devices that can now be fabricated with low-cost CMOS-compatible manufacturing techniques. I will then cover new directions in power minimization, variation tolerance, fault resilience, and security for communication and computation with silicon photonics. I will share experiences from my journey over the past decade and a half towards the goal of realizing viable silicon photonic networks and computing substrates. I will end the talk with a discussion of the key challenges and opportunities to achieve unparalleled performance and energy-efficiency gains in future smart electronic systems with silicon photonics enabled acceleration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Biography :<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sudeep Pasricha received the B.E. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Delhi Institute of Technology, India, in 2000, after which he spent several years working for STMicroelectronics, India\/France, and Conexant, USA.
