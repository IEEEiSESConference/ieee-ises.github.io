                    <!-- Abstract -->
                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> As electronic hardware systems become increasingly integral to
                        critical infrastructure, they face heightened risks from sophisticated threats such as Hardware
                        Trojan insertions and malware, which can compromise their security and reliability. These
                        malicious interventions, often stealthily embedded during the manufacturing process, pose
                        significant challenges in ensuring the integrity of electronic components. This talk addresses
                        the growing concerns surrounding hardware security by exploring advanced techniques and
                        technologies used in the detection and mitigation of these threats.We begin by introducing the
                        concept of Hardware Trojans and malware within the context of electronic hardware systems. The
                        discussion will cover the potential vectors for these malicious insertions, the impact they can
                        have on system functionality, and the challenges associated with detecting and neutralizing them
                        in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.Next, we delve into the technological foundations
                        of semiconductor packages and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing. We explore the
                        differences and advancements in 2D, 2.5D, and 3D process integration, highlighting how each
                        stage of technological evolution introduces both opportunities for improved performance and new
                        vulnerabilities for exploitation. The focus then shifts to advanced hardware assurance
                        techniques for Integrated Circuits (ICs) and PCBs. A key method discussed is the use of a
                        Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM), a powerful tool that enables
                        high-resolution inspection of ICs. FIB-SEM allows for the precise identification of hardware
                        anomalies and unauthorized modifications at the microscopic level, making it an essential tool
                        in the fight against hardware tampering. Complementing this approach is the use of X-ray
                        Computed Tomography (CT) for reverse engineering and physical assurance of PCBs. X-ray CT
                        provides non-destructive, high-resolution 3D imaging that can reveal internal structures and
                        components of PCBs, enabling the detection of hidden modifications or anomalies that might
                        indicate the presence of a Hardware Trojan or malware. This technique is invaluable for ensuring
                        the integrity of PCBs without damaging the hardware. Lastly, we explore the role of
                        laser-assisted probing and Logic State Imaging (LSI) in hardware security. These techniques are
                        particularly effective for fault-based attack and logic state analysis when the device is under
                        operation. Laser-assisted fault attack targets specific registers during security critical
                        operation (like AES encryption) and helps leak secret information. Logic state Analysis LSI
                        reveals a real-time picture of the inner workings of the device during its operation, to enable
                        us to reveal internal circuit logic states. These methods allow us a detailed understanding of
                        the real-time internal workings of electronic components, enabling the detection of any
                        malicious modifications that could compromise their functionality. This talk provides a
                        comprehensive overview of the current threats to electronic hardware systems and the advanced
                        technologies used to ensure their security. By understanding the underlying semiconductor
                        package technology with advanced inspection and imaging techniques, we can better protect our
                        electronic infrastructure from the ever-evolving landscape of hardware-based threats.</p>

                    <br>
                    <!-- Abstract -->
                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Modern era has witnessed a dramatic increase in circuit complexity
                        from a few hundreds of gates to billions and trillions of gates. This has resulted in an almost
                        insurmountable challenge of verifying that a given circuit has been designed correctly with
                        respect to its requirements. Evidently, this has become the most dominating task in the chip
                        design industry. It has been widely acknowledged that verification is often accounting for more
                        than 70% of the design cycle time – it is also becoming indispensable considering the use of
                        electronic chips in a wide range of safety critical embedded systems, including medical
                        instruments, automotive, avionic control systems, and atomic reactors. In the context of
                        embedded software based control, the verification task has an even bigger challenge of
                        addressing the correctness concerns for both the hardware and the software running on it.
                        Traditional simulation-based methods have been the forerunner for the verification task for ages
                        with an ability to uncover complex design bugs. However, with circuit sizes growing at an
                        unimaginable pace, these methods are often losing steam. The inability to explore all design
                        behaviors and expose all design flaws, limits the practical utility of simulation. Formal
                        verification (FV) has become an interesting alternative given its exhaustiveness and ability to
                        uncover corner-case bugs. FV has thus established itself as an essential technology during the
                        past couple of decades to complement the coverage achievable with simulation. In many
                        disciplines, FV today has become a mandate. The aim of this tutorial is to portray a roadmap of
                        FV, from its inception to where it stands today. We cover both the theory that drives this
                        fascinating technology along with a detailed discussion on the techniques, and a practical FV
                        flow with System Verilog Assertions (SVA), the language of choice for modeling requirements
                        formally. We conclude with a demonstration of FV.</p>

                    <!-- Title -->
                    <h2 id="Janakiraman">From C to Assembly</h2>
                    <br>
                    <!-- Abstract -->
                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> C Programming is a widely popular programming language that finds
                        applications in software, kernels, and embedded systems. Students, in their undergraduate
                        degree, do extensive courses in C programming. On the other hand, assembly language allows
                        direct access to the full potential of a microprocessor in terms of speed and functionality,
                        which is again dealt with in great detail in various courses. However, two are isolated from
                        each other and students do not have a clear picture of how a program is translated to assembly
                        or what happens in various segments of the memory when a C program executes in a microprocessor.
                        This tutorial will focus “compiling” a C program to assembply lanague and demonstrating the
                        details, via animations and examples, of what happens in the memory of the processor. The
                        details of the stack set up for a function, how local variables are allocated and handled will
                        be dealt with in great detail. Function parameter passing, including that of variable argument
                        list functions will be done extensively. The tutorial will take you through the basics of the
                        x86 instructions, mostly encountered in taking a C program to assembly, and then introduce the
                        audience to inline assembly programming and conclude with a discussion on some advanced topics
                        of security issues on the stack, efficiency of recursion, and exploiting some hardware loops in
                        x86 to speed up certain functions like memcpy and strlen. </p>
