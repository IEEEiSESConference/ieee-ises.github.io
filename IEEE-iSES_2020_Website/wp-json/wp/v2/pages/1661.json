Wide power-performance adaptation down to nWs is becoming crucial in always-on nearly real-time and energy-autonomous silicon systems that are subject to wide variability in the power availability and the performance target. Wide adaptation is indeed a prerequisite to assure continuous operation in spite of the widely fluctuating energy\/power source (e.g., energy harvester), and to grant swift response upon the occurrence of events of interest (e.g., on-chip data analytics), while maintaining extremely low consumption in the common case. These requirements have led to the strong demand of systems having an extremely wide performance-power scalability and adaptation, so that they can relentlessly operate without interruption in spite of the highly-uncertain power availability.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this talk, new directions to drastically extend the performance-power scalability of digital, analog and power management circuits and architectures are presented. New directions to achieve full-system coordinated power-performance scaling across all other sub-systems are also discussed. Silicon demonstrations and trends in the state of the art of battery-light, battery-less and battery-indifferent systems are illustrated to quantify the benefits offered by wide power-performance adaptation, identifying opportunities and challenges for the decade ahead. Finally, a mm-scale integrated system that operates uninterruptedly when solely powered by moonlight is demonstrated, paving the way to a new generation of always-on systems with little or no battery. This ultimately makes our world smarter through ubiquitous always-on edge devices, and greener through the exclusive adoption of sustainable energy sources.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Biography :<\/strong> Massimo Alioto is with the ECE Department of the National University of Singapore, where he leads the Green IC group, the Integrated Circuits and Embedded Systems area and the FD &#8211; Fabrics industry-sponsored lab on FD-SOI intelligent &amp; connected systems.

Today, the complex electronic systems quite often achieve first pass success from concept to deployment, thanks to mature CAD tools that help manage very diverse building blocks, with hierarchy of abstraction. However, the basic tenet of transistor scaling is staring at the red brick wall, due to scientific and technological challenges. It is contemplated that non-CMOS architectures enabled by nanotechnology and heterogeneous integration must drive the Moore&#8217;s law in future and enable the intelligent systems, beyond the conventional scaling era.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I believe that the stage is now set for a new wave of electronic systems to be equipped with massive sensory functions, specifically with biological and chemical sensors, going beyond conventional compute and storage paradigm. However, not much attention is given to develop a holistic approach to manage the diversity and scaling issues of sensor blocks, akin to what was done in digital, analog and mixed signal electronics. I will present two case studies from our research: (i) Biosensor systems for point of care diagnostics : the story of managing the sensing of multiple analytes in blood and urine with an eventual goal to realize &#8220;Lab on Palm&#8221; (ii) Gas sensor systems for environmental monitoring, breath analysis and hazardous gas leakage detection, with an eventual goal to realize the &#8220;Electronic Nose&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With this backdrop, I will end my talk with some thoughts on future challenges in achieving highly complex and intelligent electronic sensory systems.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Biography :<\/strong> Navakanta Bhat received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA in 1996.

Several unique attributes of e-Cash are appealing to customers, including the convenience of always having &#8220;cash-on-hand&#8221; without the need to periodically visit the ATM, the ability to perform peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary, and the peace of mind associated in conducting those transactions privately. Equally important is that paper (fiat) money provides customers with an anonymous method of payment, which is highly valued by many individuals. Although anonymity is implicit with fiat money, it is a difficult property to preserve within e-Cash schemes. Beyond anonymity, e-Cash systems must also provide a secure transaction mechanism to guard against counterfeiting, fraud, and double spending. In this talk, I will discuss several protocols that we have developed and tested that leverage the security properties of a physical unclonable function (PUF). A PUF is a hardware security primitive that is capable of providing an unlimited supply of secret keys and bit strings for authentication and encryption operations within an e-Cash message exchange protocol. Our PUF-cash protocols also integrate reinforcement learning algorithms to increase the robustness of the protocols&#8217; security properties, adding a &#8220;smart&#8221; layer of defense against adversarial attacks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Biography<\/strong> <strong>:<\/strong> Professor Plusquellic received both his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh in 1995 and 1997, respectively.
