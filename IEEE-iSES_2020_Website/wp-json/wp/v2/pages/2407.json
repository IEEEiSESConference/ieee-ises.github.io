The smart cities have been envisioned to mitigate the problems of rapid migration of human population in in both man-made and natural resources constraint. The smart cities use one or multiple smart systems including smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart agriculture, smart infrastructure, and smart grids, and hence in an essence is a system of systems. The systems of the smart cities are essentially cyber-physical systems or CPS which are built using Internet of Things (IoT). A smart city utilizes information gathered from interconnected sensors to enhance city activities, oversee resources and assets, and improve the everyday existence of its residents. Smart village concept that combines renewable energy and community-based education can have impact on estimated 940 million population worldwide. Further, smart villages target consumer technologies in rural areas to develop innovative solutions to improve the quality of life and provide growth opportunities to its residents. The smart villages exhibit certain characteristics which may have some commonalities with smart cities, but also some distinctly different. This panel will discuss technology innovation for smart cities to smart villages. The topics covered include sensors and internet of things for smart cities and smart villages, smart healthcare, smart education, digital infrastructure development in villages, community infrastructure development, smart skills development for urban residents and farmers in villages.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Panelists Biography :<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-2446 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ieee-ises.org\/2020\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/oui-06-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Prof. Himanshu Thapliyal, <\/strong><strong>University of Kentucky, USA<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr. Himanshu Thapliyal<\/strong> is an Associate Professor and Endowed Robley D.
