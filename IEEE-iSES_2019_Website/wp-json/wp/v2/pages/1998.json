As an example of cyber-attack, software vulnerabilities could be exploited to remotely take control of safety-critical systems in the vehicle. These cyberattacks are threat to the reliability and safety of the smart electronic devices, consumer\u2019s personal information and piracy or cloning of intellectual property. As the IoT paradigm emerges, there are challenging requirements to design area-efficient, energy-efficient and secure systems. Further, due to novel computing paradigms such as quantum computing there is a threat that the fundamental public-key cryptography tools could be broken.  Considering these challenges, the plenary talk would provide perspective towards the energy and cybersecurity constraints on smart electronic systems and possible solutions for solving this important paradox.<\/p><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-2\"><p style=\"text-align:justify\"> <strong>Biography:<\/strong> Himanshu Thapliyal is an Assistant Professor and Endowed Robley D.

A Computing perspective of AI is \u201cDesign and development of algorithms for imparting thinking, perception and action into a machine\u201d. AI built machine or system capable of intelligent behaviour. Another definition of AI can be \u201ca discipline to impart ability into a machine to learn rather being programmed explicitly\u201d.<br \/>\nThe process of building intelligence (Thinking-Perception-Action) in a human being starts through \u201cunsupervised learning\u201d, for a new borne. When the new bourn grows up and starts going to school for formal education then it acquires the intelligence through a process under the supervision of teacher and this process is called as \u201csupervised learning\u201d. Supervised learning through formal education imparts the capability of NLP to a human being which helps it to express and communicate with its peers through a well defined communication protocol (language). As the human being grow up and starts specialized learning of skills or domain specific or subject specific learning to perform certain functions most efficiently then domain specific teaching are imparted repeatedly. This process of imparting domain specific knowledge to an adult can be largely thought of as  \u201creinforced learning\u201d.  Therefore the learning imparted to a normal human being is a mix of unsupervised, supervised and reinforced learning which develops Human intelligence.<br \/>\nThe intelligence has a temporal aspect. The intelligence acquired by a human being starts declining as the human ages and finally ceases to exist the moment the human being ceases to exist. Therefore the entire process of learning and gaining intelligence starts with the infant and ends at the death. There is no example where a human being can completely transfer the learning it acquires during its life time to another human being, therefore bootstrapping the process of learning for each newly borne.<br \/>\nUnlike human learning process intelligence can be built into a machine continuously through various mechanisms.  The process of self learning by sensing the environment \u201cUnsupervised learning\u201d, Imparting domain specific knowledge through \u201csupervised learning\u201d, then re-enforcement learning to intensify the behavioural outcome of the machine are some of the learning methods employed to built perception, thinking and action to a machine. These learning can be engineered, stored and finally can be transferred to a new system or machine through a process known as \u201cTransferred Learning\u201d.<br \/>\nThis talk will delve into various mechanism of learning technique involved in building AI into machines and systems. The concepts of Artificial Neural network (ANN), Deep Learning, Transfer Learning and reinforcement learning will be discussed with a mapping of these concepts into domain specific applications.<br \/>\n<\/p><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-6 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-2\"><p style=\"text-align:justify\"> <strong>Biography:<\/strong> Dr Narayan Panigrahi has received PhD from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, MTech (Computer Science and Data Processing) from IIT, Kharagpur, MSc (Computer Science) from J K Institute of Applied physics and Technology, University of Allahabad in the year 2012, 1999 and 1991 respectively.
