Recently deep learning has revolutionised the field of Computer Vision, disrupting more traditional algorithmic approaches to object recognition, scene analysis and image understanding. But to date most of the applications of AI have relied on cloud-based services doing the heavy-lifting. Today we are at the cusp of a new era where AI data analysis is ready to move from the cloud and transition into the end device itself. In this talk we will review some of the Neural accelerators that are available today and look 1-2 years into the future to explore some of the potential impacts of edge-AI. We will also look at some of the new challenges and opportunities as AI migrates into individual devices: data-processing in the cloud won't go away, but more interestingly new computational &amp; storage demands will emerge to support training of edge-AI. Among these will be the rise of 'Fake Data' and the VR tools and associated infrastructure required to scale the training of advanced Edge-AI solutions.<\/p><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-2\"><p style=\"text-align:justify\"> <strong>Biography:<\/strong> Peter Corcoran is Professor and Vice-Dean of Research &amp; Graduate Studies in the College of Engineering &amp; Informatics at NUI Galway.

They incorporate electronic circuits for operation. By this definition, computers, cell phones, mobile devices, LED lights, television sets, cameras, gaming stations\/consol, various home electronics, are examples of CEDs. Most CEDs require DC power to drive the electronic circuits.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPower converter plays an important role in powering Consumer Electronic Devices (CEDs). The talk will discuss a review of basic philosophy and challenges of power converter design for CEDs. It will be observed that the power converter acts like a voltage source or a current source from the consumer electronic load point-of-view. Fundamental concepts behind implementation of a current source and voltage source using a power converter will bediscussed. The important design criteria for power converter implementation will also be covered.<\/p><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-6 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-2\"><p style=\"text-align:justify\"> <strong>Biography:<\/strong> Santanu K.

These improvements are most visible to all of us in our SmartPhones that already feature a panoply of miniaturized sensors. Many of the same sensors are also positively impacting several other application domains. In this talk, we highlight how smart light-weight body worn sensors are set to revolutionize healthcare and the practice of medicine by providing technologies for assessing biomarkers for physiological and physical attributes related to disease condition, treatment effectiveness, and longitudinal progression. In contrast with the subjective, sporadic in-clinic assessments that are in common use today, body-worn sensors can provide objective and repeatable measurements and based on extended periods of continuous monitoring. We present examples from our recent and ongoing research that features light-weight, low-power sensors that can be affixed to the body like adhesive temporary tattoos, in a diverse set of health monitoring applications including quantification of movement disorders for Parkinson\u2019s and Huntington\u2019s diseases, stroke rehabilitation, and cardiac monitoring. We present examples of data analytics for these applications that effectively exploit the sensor measurements. Finally, we highlight ongoing and emerging directions for research and development.<\/p><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-9 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-2\"><p style=\"text-align:justify\"> <strong>Biography:<\/strong> Gaurav Sharma is a professor in the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Biostatistics and Computational Biology, and a Distinguished Researcher in Center of Excellence in Data Science (CoE) at the Goergen Institute for Data Science at the University of Rochester.
