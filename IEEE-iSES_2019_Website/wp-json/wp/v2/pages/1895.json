Key Theme<\/h1>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The primary objective of IEEE-iSES (formerly IEEE-iNIS) is to provide a platform for both hardware and software researchers to interact under one umbrella for further development of smart electronic systems. Efficient and secure data sensing, storage, and processing play pivotal roles in current information age. The state-of-the-art smart electronic systems cater to the needs of efficient sensing, storage, and computing. At the same time, efficient algorithms and software used for faster analysis and retrieval of desired information are becoming increasingly important. Big data which are large, complex data sets, are now a part of the Internet world. Storing and processing needs of the enormous amount of structured and unstructured data are getting increasingly challenging. At the same time, Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been evolving with simultaneous development of hardware and software and span across everyday consumer electronics. The performance and efficiency of the present as well as the future generations of computing and information processing systems are largely dependent upon advances in both hardware and software. IEEE-iSES has been initiated as a sponsored meeting of Technical Committee on VLSI, IEEE-CS (http:\/\/www.ieee-tcvlsi.org\/) that endorses a league of successful meetings including ASAP, ISVLSI, and ARITH, are now presented as \u201cSister Conferences\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2.

Big Data presents multiple challenges including privacy, analysis, search, storage, transfer, and visualization. Novel hardware and software mechanisms are needed to address these challenges, and make Big Data useful for end users.
